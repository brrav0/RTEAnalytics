## RTEAnalytics

RTEAnalytics is an INSEAD project which aims at getting familiar with R by using RTE (French Electricity Distribution Network) data. The project aims at producing a small report which will verify basic knowledge about the electricty market (prices, renewable energy, ratio consumption/production...) 

## Data source

Data has been provided by RTE on the French government open data website.

Open data: https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/electricite-consommation-production-co2-et-echanges/

## Objective

The report may include (subject to change) over the 2012-2014 period:
- Comparison of supply and demand
- Evolution of energy mix
- Correlation between time of the day and solar energy
- Correlation between time of the day and wind energy
- Correlation between supply and demand vs. import/export
- Correlation between consumption and weather (require import of another set of data)
